## Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It's used for developing cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter enables developers to deliver high-performance, visually attractive applications with its reactive framework, rich set of widgets, and development tools.
