## Make Apps For Linux

Desktop and mobile Linux users have a healthy appetite for new software. Linux app stores and repositories lack applications compared to their proprietary counterparts.

Technical enthusiasts are encouraged to direct their passion and creativity towards creating fresh apps for Linux users.

## Why Create More Applications

### Scratch an Itch

Ever had an idea for an application you personally need? You may find others have a similar desire for your application idea. Scratch that itch.

### Collaborate

Building applications fosters communities. Linux communities often want to help developers succeed. Make something people want, and build a group of fans and contributors around it.

### Broaden the ecosystem

New applications can inspire new developers on Linux. Building applications in the open allows developers even newer than yourself to learn and get started. Help build the next Linux app generation.

### Learn new skills

Developing applications is a sought-after skill. There are many free training resources to help you learn to develop software. Level up your résumé!

### Be creative

Developing applications is a naturally creative endeavour. The sense of fulfilment gained when completing a project can be very rewarding. Exercise that half of your brain.

### Earn a wage

Build popular paid applications and services. It’s a myth that Linux users don’t support developers financially. Use this as an opportunity to create a new source of income for yourself.

## Target All The Linux Distributions

Unlike other platforms, Linux is a very diverse target. There are hundreds of Linux distributions, some more popular than others. Once published though, applications can generally work everywhere.

There are well documented software packaging and distribution systems which enable developers to get their applications into the hands of users.

Each developer framework and Linux distribution will have their own recommended route to users. When you’re ready to share your creation, the development documentation will signpost their suggested packaging guides.

## Where To Start

### GNOME

The GNOME project builds the popular GNOME Shell desktop, and enables development based around Gjs and Gtk. Popular programming languages may be used with Gtk, including Python, C, C++, Rust, and even Javascript.

### KDE Frameworks

KDE produces the widely-used Plasma desktop and the tools and frameworks to create applications. The KDE Frameworks have enabled the development of many diverse desktop applications. KDE Frameworks primarily leverage the Qt toolkit and C++ programming language.

### Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It's used for developing cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter enables developers to deliver high-performance, visually attractive applications with its reactive framework, rich set of widgets, and development tools.

### Electron 

Electron enables developers to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron developers can leverage the vast library of node modules to build their own applications on web technologies.
